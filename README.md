# tarheeltictactoe
A fully accessible website that allows individuals with disabilities to play games against an AI bot. In this case, the game we chose to make using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS was an AI version of Tic-Tac-Toe. We also included an adapted version of a matching game. This app uses a Head-tracking API that allows individuals to interact with the website via head/gaze tracking. 

This project utilizes an open source API provided by X-labs in order to provide for the overall head-tracking and gazing functionality. Our website attributes the construction and partial functionality of the AI Tic-Tac-Toe game to Mostafa Samir. We also recognize Nate Wiley for the construction of the matching game. Full crediting can be found in the license.txt file.

This website is built for all individuals to play by 3 UNC Computer Science students. Mila Korobkina and Parth Patel were also the authors of this project and deserve full recognition. 

This project was a semester long endeavor in order to pursue better methods of enabling technologies. We were inspired by the idea of interaction by head-tracking, so we used our newly founded computer scinece skills in order to build off of Mostafa and Nate's code to create amazing games for children with disabilities. We hope that you enjoy!
